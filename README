---> INTRODUCTION <---

Picochan is imageboard software.

Key features which differentiate picochan from mainstream imageboard software
like vichan and friends:

  - No javascript of any type is used anywhere. In fact, CSP is used to block
    execution of any and all javascript, which makes XSS attacks impossible.
    Despite this, many "javascript" features such as floating reply box,
    working mobile view, inline image expansion etc. are present
  - High speed and small code size
  - High security due to the use of pledge() and unveil()
  - Highly transparent moderation logs which include a reason for all
    moderation actions such as deleting a post, autosaging a thread etc.

For reference, this software is loosely based upon nanochan, but most of it
is rewritten. Several key improvements exist in picochan which do not exist in
nanochan:

  - Support for multiple files per post has been introduced
  - Support for inline image expansion has been introduced
  - Support for cross-board links where the post linked to is not a thread has
    been introduced
  - Support for intra-board links where the post linked to is not in the
    current thread has been introduced
  - Redirects are now done through HTTP 303 rather than HTML meta http-equiv
  - More board settings have been introduced
  - Database structure is significantly improved. This increases speed by a
    large amount (orders of magnitude), especially with large boards or long
    threads
  - Backend and frontend are separate. This improves code simplicity a little
    and also allows for more frontends (e.g. json) in the future
  - LuaJIT is used for the backend (and thus the frontend), and the software's
    speed is further improved

Other more minor changes:

  - Theme has been changed to dark. CSS was modified.
  - Site name can be changed through the administration interface and is
    no longer hard-coded.
  - Opening the post box using the keyboard shortcut no longer jumps you
    back up to the top of the page.
  - Posts do not include redundant <br> elements.
  - Formatting has been improved slightly.

The nanochan-1.0 source code can be found at /nanochan-1.0.tar.gz
(this is not the same version as which Nanochan currently runs, though: it
is merely the last version that I have on hand)

Installation instructions can be found at /install.txt

The latest release of picochan is picochan-2.6.

---> picochan-2.6 <---
It can be downloaded from /picochan-2.6.tar.gz

This version contains one minor bugfix.

  - Fixed a bug in which the index page was not shown due to accidentally
    passing a board table to html.renderpost().

---> picochan-2.5 <---
It can be downloaded from /picochan-2.5.tar.gz

This version contains minor improvements.

  - Duplicate require() of openbsd aux-lib removed
  - CSS fixes to stop overflow of file names on mobile devices

---> picochan-2.4 <---
It can be downloaded from /picochan-2.4.tar.gz

This version contains a number of fixes and improvements from neeshy
<neeshy@tfwno.gf>. Other patches which he provided, but were not applied for
various reasons can be found in /patches-2.3.tar.gz

  - File processing code has been shortened.
  - Trailing whitespace in source code has been removed.
  - An inconsistency in the random number generation for captchas has been
    corrected.
  - Fixed behavior of string.tokenize() when the delimiter is '.'
  - Fixed file extension code to work correctly with multiple extensions.
  - Log pages now use a pathinfo parameter rather than a GET parameter, to
    improve consistency with other parts of picochan.
  - Spurious board_tbl parameters have been removed throughout the code.
  - Catalog rendering function has been streamlined.
  - Erroneous PDF "inline expansion" has been removed and replaced with normal
    click-to-view behavior.
  - Inline image expansion has been modified to greatly improve the space used
    by the expanded image.

---> picochan-2.3 <---
It can be downloaded from /picochan-2.3.tar.gz

This version contains a small number of minor improvements.

  - Formatting bugs involving a redtext containing one character have been
    fixed.
  - A favicon has been added. In the future, this favicon will be made
    configurable.
  - A bug involving threads started with a text file has been fixed.
  - Incorrect board links in mod logs have been repaired.

---> picochan-2.2 <---
It can be downloaded from /picochan-2.2.tar.gz

This version contains a small number of minor improvements.

  - URLs encased in brackets () <> [] {} are now rendered correctly.
  - The spurious "iomisc" auxiliary library has been removed, since its
    functionality is no longer needed.

---> picochan-2.1 <---
It can be downloaded from /picochan-2.1.tar.gz

In this version, a number of small new features and improvements have been
added.

  - Text file support has been added.
  - Minor UI improvement: clicking on a post No. link no longer allows the
    header to obscure the start of the post.
  - Minor UI bugfix: EPUB icons now correctly point to the file to be
    downloaded when displayed beside a post.
  - Multidelete and pattern-delete has been added to the moderation tools.
    This allows moderators to delete large amounts of spam in a short time.
    Note that they are extremely powerful and have the capacity to cause
    massive destruction if not used carefully, so they have been restricted
    to administrators and board owners.
  - Captcha expiry time has been changed to 20 minutes.

---> picochan-2.0 <---
It can be downloaded from /picochan-2.0.tar.gz

In this version, a number of small architectural improvements have been made.
Most notably, thread view has been sped up to twice its original speed, and
this factor is greater when there are many files in the thread. Minor bugs
have been corrected. This is a milestone release.

  - Temporary files are no longer created to store the output of the HTML
    frontend. Instead, the output is stored in memory. This reduces I/O and
    filesystem usage, although speed is not impacted that much.
  - The processing of references has been disabled in catalog and overboard
    views. This prevents people from making threads with huge numbers of
    references to slow down catalog view, and it also speeds up catalog view
    by a small amount.
  - A bug regarding global variable configuration has been corrected.
  - The bcrypt_rounds parameter for bcrypt is now configurable through the
    database rather than requiring a source code modification.
  - The SQLite application_id and user_version fields are now used. The value
    for application_id is 37564 and, for picochan-2.0, the value for
    user_version is 1. This value will be incremented every version where
    there are changes to the database schema.
  - Miscellaneous string and io extensions have been moved into the picochan
    auxiliary library.
  - The SQLite secure_delete feature is now enabled. In practice, this will
    mean that posts which contain links to e.g. child pornography will not
    remain in the database after they have been deleted.
  - Seek operations on files have now been wrapped in assertions.
  - Board and thread locks are now enforced through the use of the permit()
    function rather than through manual checks.
  - The captcha has been adjusted to make it more difficult for software to
    find the answer.
  - Inline image expansion is now limited to the width and height of the
    user's viewport. Previously, the expanded image overflowed off the edge
    of the screen, which was not user-friendly.

---> picochan-1.9 <---
It can be downloaded from /picochan-1.9.tar.gz

In this version, a big change has been made. Picochan has been converted to
use LuaJIT instead of Lua 5.3, which increases the speed of certain lua-
intensive sections of the code, most notably the file displaying code. It
also no longer depends on any external Lua libraries, since all such libraries
were rewritten specifically for picochan using the LuaJIT FFI. Brotli page
compression has been re-introduced as promised, and security was bumped up
greatly through the use of OpenBSD pledge() and unveil() functions. Besides
that major improvement, lots of small changes and minor features have been
introduced as well:

  - A potential bug has been proactively corrected in the html.table.begin()
    and html.table.entry() functions. In previous versions, if a nil value
    were passed as part of the varargs, the function would stop reading
    successive values. Now, all values are read.
  - The LibreSSL library is no longer used for random number generation.
    Instead, the arc4random() system call specific to OpenBSD (which is
    provided in the openbsd auxlib) is used.
  - The permissions system for mod actions has been totally reworked. Instead
    of writing out manual if-else statements for each use case, a new permit()
    function is used to check permissions. It returns more specific error
    messages and was mainly intended to reduce the incidence of permissions-
    related bugs, which would be classed as severe.
  - Support for WebP images has been introduced. This is a very minor change,
    but is useful because WebP offers greatly reduced file sizes for the same
    image quality.

Installation instructions for versions of picochan prior to 1.9 can be found
at /install-pre19.txt

---> picochan-1.8 <---
It can be downloaded from /picochan-1.8.tar.gz

In this version, the last major feature before the 2.0 point release has been
added: thread moving, a feature by which the moderators with global
jurisdiction (admins and gvols) can move threads across boards.
Picochan will now go into feature freeze until 2.0; only bug-fixes and
improvements will be made.

Many major and minor improvements have also been made in this release, which
include significant performance improvements in some areas:
  - The file hashing algorithm has been changed to SHA-512 as opposed to the
    old SHA-256. This change was made to improve posting speeds, since SHA-512
    is significantly faster on 64-bit computers (i.e. the vast majority).
  - Reply counts for threads are now stored in the database as opposed to
    being counted (through the SQL COUNT() function). This has slashed catalog
    and overboard generation times by around 40-50%, and probably some small
    improvements to everything else which used to use COUNT() (e.g. database
    triggers, thread view, index view).
  - A bug related to thread bumping was corrected.
  - A bug related to thread sliding was corrected.
  - An index was added to the database to slightly speed up captcha
    verification.
  - pico.file.list() in the backend was sped up by around 30% through the use
    of transactions and individual statements.

---> picochan-1.7 <---
It can be downloaded from /picochan-1.7.tar.gz

In this version, another major feature has been added. There is a recent posts
page now available, showing the newest posts site-wide. This is mainly
intended for moderator use, but normal users may also use it.

Minor improvements this release:
  - The useless per-board accesskey feature has been removed.
  - Clicking on a post "No." link from anywhere brings you to that post in its
    parent thread.
  - Log page size is no longer hardcoded and is now a global configuration
    variable.

---> picochan-1.6 <---
It can be downloaded from /picochan-1.6.tar.gz

In this version, a major new feature has been added. The index view is now
available in addition to the catalog view. Catalog view remains the default
view for a board.

Minor improvements have been made:
  - Certain form fields in the mod tools receive focus automatically upon page
    load. For example, the "reason" field in a post deletion form is
    automatically focused.
  - The database column "MaxPostImages" has been renamed to "MaxPostFiles"
    since it applies not only to images but to videos, audios etc.
  - The OP of a thread is now displayed without a border and a background
    color. This is consistent with the behavior of other imageboard software
    and additionally provides more of a distinction between the OP and the
    replies.
  - Bugs related to global variable configuration have been corrected.
  - A bug related to an unsanitized format string for the front page has been
    corrected.
  - Default values for board settings have been changed to more conservative
    ones, now that the software has been confirmed to work well with large
    amounts of data.
  - The empty nanochan.db file is no longer bundled with the distribution. It
    should instead be created using the nanochan.sql schema. This decision was
    made to slightly reduce the distribution file size and reduce the work
    required to package each release.

---> picochan-1.5 <---
It can be downloaded from /picochan-1.5.tar.gz

In this version, brotli compression support has been removed (hopefully only
temporarily) because the brotli module that was being used was unmaintained
and does not compile on OpenBSD despite considerable tinkering. Hopefully, a
new brotli module (perhaps using bindings to google's C library) can be found
or written.

This is not a huge deal because tor browser doesn't support brotli without
editing about:config. However, it is still intended that brotli support be
re-added in the future.

Other changes:
  - Small formatting engine fixes
  - Final database refinements

---> picochan-1.4 <---
It can be downloaded from /picochan-1.4.tar.gz

This version contains major improvements.

  - Database has been optimized. Speed has been improved greatly by the usage
    of indexes. Generation time for catalogs, threads, stats, and logs will
    be much better for large numbers of posts.
  - Bugs related to cyclical threads and thread sliding have been corrected.
    Before, cyclical threads did not work, and threads did not slide off the
    catalog.

This version also contains minor improvements.

  - Formatting has been restricted to a single line. This means that sequences
    of characters which are not likely to be intentional formatting are no
    longer considered formatting.

---> picochan-1.3 <---
It can be downloaded from /picochan-1.3.tar.gz

This version contains bugfixes.

  - A database bug causing references to malfunction was fixed.
  - A backend bug causing cross-board references to malfunction was fixed.
  - A backend bug causing posts' files to be out of order was fixed.
  - Formatting bugs have been fixed.

---> picochan-1.2 <---
It can be downloaded from /picochan-1.2.tar.gz

This version, again, contains a small number of minor improvements.

  - Front page has been implemented.
  - Bugs (including security bugs) have been fixed.

This is the first version I would seriously consider using in production,
since the other versions are incomplete and/or were not tested thoroughly.

---> picochan-1.1 <---
It can be downloaded from /picochan-1.1.tar.gz

This version contains a small number of minor improvements.

  - Inline image expansion has been added. It uses only CSS to work, not
    JavaScript.
  - The image download link has been converted to a view link, and a new
    image download link has been created.

---> picochan-1.0 <---
It can be downloaded from /picochan-1.0.tar.gz

This version is quite rough around the edges. All core functionality has been
implemented but probably has lots of bugs. Also, the front page is currently
blank and won't show anything, because it's not implemented.
