Picochan is very easy to install. Its dependencies are:

  DEPENDENCY        TESTED VERSION   DISTRIBUTION URL
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  brotli            1.0.7            https://brotli.org
  argon2            20190702         https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2
  sqlite            3.32.3           https://sqlite.org
  luajit            2.0.5            https://luajit.org
  graphicsmagick    1.3.35           http://graphicsmagick.org
  ffmpeg            4.2.4            https://ffmpeg.org
  haserl            0.9.35           http://haserl.sourceforge.net

On a freshly installed Gentoo system, Picochan was made to work by first
installing the following packages through portage. The relevant USE flags are
also given (your results may vary if you do not follow the USE flags listed,
for example, thumbnails for AV1-encoded videos may not be generated if you
do not enable the dav1d USE-flag for ffmpeg).

  app-arch/brotli
  app-crypt/argon2
  dev-db/sqlite
  dev-lang/luajit           USE="lua52compat"
  media-gfx/graphicsmagick  USE="jpeg png webp svg openmp threads bzip2 zlib"
  media-video/ffmpeg        USE="dav1d vpx x265 gpl"

Additionally, you must also install haserl which is not available through the
gentoo repositories. Fortunately, on Linux it is easy and quick to compile by
yourself.

---> HASERL <---

Download the source tarball through the distribution URL provided.
When compiling haserl, make sure to use the following configure options. A
failure to use these options will most likely result in picochan not working.

  --enable-luashell
  --disable-luacshell
  --disable-bashshell
  --disable-bash-extensions
  --enable-subshell=lua
  --with-lua=luajit

---> FINAL PREPARATIONS <---

Create the database:

  $ sqlite3 picochan.db <picochan.sql

Point your web browser at the picochan installation. Log in as an admin using
the username 'setup' and the password 'password'. Use this account to create a
new administrator account using your username and a different password. Then,
delete the setup account. Picochan is now ready to use.
